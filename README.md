# BrisT1D
This is a repository for predicting BrisT1D blood glucose with machine learning and distributed processing.

This is for the class of Advanced Big Data Analysis at Chonnam National University in the second semester of 2024.

## Description
This project is based on the Kaggle competition [BrisT1D Blood Glucose Prediction Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/brist1d). The goal of this competition is to predict the blood glucose levels of patients with type 1 diabetes. The dataset contains 31 features and 1 target variable. The target variable is the blood glucose level of the patient. The features include the patient.

## Dataset
The dataset is available on the Kaggle competition page.
